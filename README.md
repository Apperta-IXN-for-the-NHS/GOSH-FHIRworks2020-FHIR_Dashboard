# FHIR-Hackathon

## Chosen Task
1. Graphing data from FHIR records and preparing data for transfer to XML and CSV.
2. Then create a dashboard that presents a human-readable representation of the data of a FHIR server.

## Background
Great Ormond Street Hospital, a specialist children’s centre, has established a digital research unit,
including NHS clinicians, UCL academics and industry partners. The aim is to improve child health
by optimising the use of clinical data for research.
This task, incorporating the two-day FHIRworks Hackathon, will create a library of example
developer packages that use the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.
Students will use synthetically generated data retrieved over FHIR from a GOSH gateway to
demonstrate capabilities and advantages of the FHIR standard for the collection and safe handling
of healthcare data. This approach will support the development of various healthcare apps, for
patients, families and healthcare professionals, like existing phone apps used regularly by
millions. There is already a collection of synthetic records on GOSH DRIVE’s FHIR server.
HL7 FHIR is a next generation standards JSON based framework that leverages the latest web
standards and includes a RESTful API. FHIR interoperability ensures data is collected, accessed,
and used in a safe and secure manner.
